Repo Contents:

1. Excalibur.py, myFile.txt, uploads (folder), camelot-image.png
	This is the backend code. Excalibur.py reads in a file named "camelot-image.png" from the uploads folder, uses the AruCo library from OpenCV to analyze it, and outputs a file named "myFile.txt".

2. index.html, results.html, results-mobile.html, camelot.css, camelot.js, upload.php
	This is the frontend code. Together, these pages allow a user to take a photo of our modified Shadows Over Camelot game board, upload the picture to the server to be analyzed (camelot-image.png), and outputs the server's response (whatever is in myFile.txt).
	
3. Everything else
	All of the other files were auto generated by XAMPP and were left default. XAMPP is used for hosting a local PHP server. 


Note: many of the commits are from a user named "MRXDiamonds", and although Jordan Peters created the repo, he has no commits in it. This is because Jordan Peters created that account for an activity for a class he taught, and cannot figure out how to change Github desktop to revert to using his normal account.
